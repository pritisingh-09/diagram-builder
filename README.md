**diagram-builder** is a Python-based project that allows you to generate beautiful and customizable architecture/system diagrams using code, powered by the [Diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com) library.

It supports major cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, and more. Whether you’re documenting infrastructure or building visual workflows, this tool makes it simple and repeatable.

It is an approach that allows you to create diagrams through code instead of traditional graphic tools. Instead of manually building diagrams, you can write code in a text file to define the structure, components, and connections of your diagrams.

`diagram-builder` lets you define diagrams as code and automatically generates visual diagrams from structured definitions. It simplifies the process of documenting architectures and workflows, making it easy to maintain, share, and update diagrams programmatically.


# What is Diagrams?  
**Diagrams** is a **🐍Python library** that implements the Diagram as Code approach, enabling you to create architectural infrastructure diagrams and other types of diagrams through code. With Diagrams, you can easily define cloud infrastructure components (such as `AWS`, `Azure`, and `GCP`), network elements, software services, and more, all with just a few lines of code.

### 🎉 Benefits of Diagram-Builder
* 📝 **Representation of Diagrams as Code**: Create and update diagrams directly from code, ensuring maintainability in agile projects.
* 📑 **Automated Documentation**: Generate visuals from code, keeping diagrams aligned with the current architecture.
* 🔄 **Change Control**: Track diagram modifications over time.
* 🔍 **Enhanced Clarity**: Improve understanding of complex systems with clear, shared visuals.
* ✏️ **Customizable**: Represent cloud infrastructures, workflows, or data pipelines with flexible and tailored visuals.
